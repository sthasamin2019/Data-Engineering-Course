"""
Day 2 - Example 3: Branching Logic & Trigger Rules
====================================================
Live-code this alongside slide 7.

Demonstrates:
  - BranchPythonOperator choosing one path over another at runtime
  - trigger_rule="none_failed" to join branches back together cleanly
  - trigger_rule="one_failed" to run a cleanup/alert task only on failure

Run it with: place this file in your dags/ folder, then trigger
"branching_and_trigger_rules_demo". Try triggering it on a weekday vs.
editing is_weekend() to force the other branch, and watch which tasks
run vs. get marked "skipped" in the Grid view.
